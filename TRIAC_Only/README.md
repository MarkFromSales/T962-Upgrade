# T962-TRIAC
Reverse engineered TRIAC section of the T962

2019-03-18: Tested using the logic section of the ES Technical upgrade kit. Didn't run a complete cycle, only ran to 95 degrees and then cancelled. The fan and heating element worked as expected. The first run-through I had the SSR cables connected backwards.

For reference, the cable nearest the screw should be the positive of the fan
